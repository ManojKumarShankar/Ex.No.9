# Experiment 9: Exploring Prompting Techniques for Video Generation with Product Advertisements (Brand-Specific)

## Aim:

To explore how different prompting techniques influence the quality, style, and storytelling of AI-generated product advertisements, using three specific real-world brands.

## Algorithm / Procedure:

2. Apply three different prompting techniques:

   * Simple Prompt
   * Detailed Prompt
   * Stylistic Prompt

3. Generate videos using AI tools like **Runway Gen-2**, **Pika Labs**, or **Sora**.

4. Analyze outputs for:

   * Visual quality
   * Brand clarity
   * Emotional engagement
   * Product focus

## Prompting Techniques & Branded Prompt Examples

### üîπ 1. Simple Prompting

* Product: electric car

* Prompt:
  *‚Äúshort advertisement for electric car‚Äù*

* Purpose:
  Generate a basic brand-focused video with direct product visuals.

* Expected Output:
  A person running outdoors wearing **Nike shoes**, with brand logos and energetic background music. Text overlay: *‚ÄúPush Your Pace with Nike.‚Äù*

* Observation:
  The video was product-centric but lacked story or emotion. Works well for short social media ads.

### üîπ 2. Stylistic Prompting

* Product: skin care product

* Prompt:
  ‚ÄúA glass bottle of premium organic face serum placed on a polished white marble slab, surrounded by dewdrops and fresh green leaves. The camera begins with a macro close-up of a water droplet sliding down the side of the bottle, revealing its smooth reflective surface. Soft golden sunlight streams through a sheer curtain in the background, casting warm highlights and gentle shadows. Subtle mist floats in the air, creating a fresh, morning atmosphere. The shot transitions to a top-down view with soft-focus bokeh lights twinkling around the bottle. Ambient, elegant piano music plays gently in the background. The overall mood is serene, clean, luxurious, and rejuvenating. Style is cinematic with shallow depth of field, smooth camera movement, and high contrast between glossy textures and matte natural surroundings'‚Äù



## Suggested AI Tools for Video Generation

* Runway Gen-2 ‚Äì Text-to-video, great for quick prototypes
* Pika Labs ‚Äì Stylized animations and cinematic motion
* Kaiber / Sora (OpenAI) ‚Äì High-end story-driven visual generation (if available)

* Stylistic prompts bring emotional resonance and premium brand feel.

Prompt design significantly influences how AI tools represent **brand identity, emotion, and visual appeal** in advertisements.
